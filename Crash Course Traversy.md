# What is React?

    * Single page application (SPA) 
    * "view" layer like as in MVC (Model View Controller)
        - Model: Data
        - View: UI
        - Controller: Requests and Routing

    * JSX (Javascript Syntax Extension)
        - Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) 
        - allows to update a page without reloading it 
    * One-way data binding, can't mutate directly 
     

     <></> or <div></div>

     actions get passed down, state gets passed up


     With backend, we'll be making http or fetch request

     Use && to make a ternary without else
